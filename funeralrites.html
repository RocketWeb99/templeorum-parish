      <h1>Welcome To Templeorum Parish Co. Kilkenny</h1>
      <p> <p><p><strong><u>Celebrating a Catholic Funeral</u><br />
          <br />
      </strong>The Catholic Church has developed a deep and rich tradition in its liturgy  for funerals. This liturgy seeks to balance the need to console those who are  mourning with the hope in the person of Jesus Christ who is our life and our  resurrection. The Catholic Funeral Rites are a meaningful expression of faith  and are a meaningful experience. They commend the deceased to the mercy of God,  and as we give thanks to God for the life of a Christian, we pray that God may  forgive whatever sins the deceased may have committed through human weakness.  The Funeral Rites&quot; represent a public sharing with the personal grief of  the family and the public liturgy of the Church.<br />
In order to preserve the very sacred nature of the Funeral Liturgy,  certain practices must be observed.<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Informing The Priest</u></strong><br />
Following the  death of a parishioner, the Priest must be notified immediately by a family  member, preferably one who is responsible for making the funeral arrangements.  This will enable the Priest, in consultation with the family and the Under taker,  to facilitate the arrangements and to meet with the family&quot; well in  advance to discuss the necessary aspects of the Funeral Rites.<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Rosaries</u></strong><br />
It is becoming customary  to pray the Rosary on two consecutive nights prior to the Reception at the  Church. It is not always possible for the Priest to attend and lead the first  Rosary. In that event, the Rosary may be led by a family member of friend or by  one of a number of Leaders to be nominated by the Liturgical Committee for that  purpose.<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Reception of the Body at the Church</u></strong>.<br />
<br />
The Reception of the body at the Church signifies the transition from the  expression of the -private, personal family grief to the public expression in  the liturgy by the parish community. It is also the first step in returning to  God the person that has been loved. If relatives wish to drape the coffin with  the national flag or any other flag or secular emblem, it must be removed  before the coffin enters the Church. The prayers and symbols used at the  Reception recall the dignity of each Christian which was given to them in  Baptism. The coffin is sprinkled with Holy Water as a remembrance that in the  Waters of Baptism, Christians receive the pledge of Eternal Life. The coffin is  placed before the Paschal Candle, symbolizing God's undying presence and His  victory over death by his Resurrection. Other Christian symbols such as the  Cross or the Book of the Gospels may also be placed on the coffin at this time.  The family may also wish to carry with them other emblems which reflect the  deceased's personality or interests. This is permissible on the clear  understanding that they do not conflict with the Christian symbols that are  used in the ceremony. A place will be provided for such items either near to  the coffin or the family but they must not displace the Christian symbols  representing the baptismal calling of the deceased.<br />
<br />
<strong><u>The Word of God<br />
</u></strong><br />
The Funeral Mass  is the central liturgical celebration for the deceased. The Word of God offers  life, hope and inspiration. A careful selection of sacred scripture for  funerals provides the family and the community with the opportunity to hear God  speak to them in their needs, sorrows, fears and hopes. There is a variety of  suitable scriptural readings from the Old and New Testaments which are  appropriate the Funeral Mass. These scriptural readings may not be replaced by  non-biblical or secular readings. It is essential that the readings be read  clearly and with sensitivity. A family member or friend may <br />
undertake these  readings but pressure must not be placed on anyone, particularly if they are  not regular readers at Mass. If required, a Parish Reader will be available to  undertake this ministry. If the family requests, reflections taken from  Christian literature may be used at a later stage in the Funeral Mass. However,  some poems and passages are best kept to the less formal stages of the Funeral  Rites in the home, the funeral home or at the graveside.</p>
      <p><strong><u>Homily<br />
        </u></strong><br />
        The Homily is  given by the Priest and is prepared in consultation with the family of the  deceased. The Homily is based on the Scriptures and on the life of the deceased  in that he or she endeavored to live out the virtues of being a true Christian.<br />
  <br />
  <strong><u>Prayers of the Faithful</u></strong><br />
  <br />
        The Prayers of  the Faithful, or general intercessions, call upon God to bring comfort to those  who mourn and to show mercy to the deceased. Family members or friends may wish  to participate in these prayers. If composed by the family, the Priest will  provide guidance regarding the format and suitable content.<br />
  <br />
  <strong><u>Offertory Gifts</u></strong><br />
  <br />
        The traditional  gifts presented for the Eucharist are the bread and wine. It is desirable that  family members bring these gifts to the altar. At this point in the Mass, it is  not appropriate to present symbols of the deceased's past life. To do so is a  confusion of the presentation of the bread and wine which become the Eucharist  for us. Furthermore, &quot;gifts&quot; are &quot;given&quot;, not merely as a  &quot;symbol&quot; or gesture only to be taken back at the end of the Mass. If  it is requested that suitable symbols associated with the interests or work of  the deceased be part of the Funeral Rites, they should be carried into the  Church at the Reception of the Body.</p>
      <p><strong><u>Words of  Appreciation<br />
        </u></strong><br />
        There are  occasions when a family member may wish to address the mourners. The Funeral  Rites offer a number of junctures at which to make such addresses. Personal  sentiments are more appropriately spoken in the intimacy of the family home or  at the funeral home. Words in the form of an 'oration* are better suited to the  traditional location of the graveside, or to the hall or hotel afterwards. The  Reception of the Body also provides an opportunity for a family member to offer  brief words of remembrance and to acknowledge those who have supported the  family in their grief. The Funeral Mass is primarily an act of praise of God  and therefore is either the appropriate occasion or place to insert a speech or  'eulogy*. In deference to the reverence due to the celebration of the Eucharist,  no exceptions will be made to this rule.<br />
  <br />
  <strong><u>Music</u></strong><br />
  <br />
        Music for  funerals should always be chosen with great care and should, in word and tone,  is primarily in praise and thanks­giving to God. Non-liturgical music is  unacceptable during the Funeral Mass. In consultation with the Priest, suitable  music and hymns should be selected for the Reception of the Body, the Funeral  Mass and the Final Commendation. It is important to remember that the  congregation be able to participate as fully as possible. Hymns, songs, chants  and instrumental music must be religious in content and must reflect the sacred  nature of the occasion. Preference should be given to the Response to the  Psalm, Gospel Acclamation, Great Amen and the Song of Farewell. The use of  pre-recorded or taped music during the celebration of Mass is completely  discouraged as it is an intrusion into the celebration of a living, worshipping  community.</p>&nbsp;</p>
