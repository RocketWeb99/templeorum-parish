      <h1>Welcome To Templeorum Parish Co. Kilkenny</h1>
      <p align="center"><strong>A message to our Parishioners during  this difficult time for all of us</strong>.</p>
      <p>We the Priests wish all of you  good health of mind and body. We are praying for your safety and we assure you that  we are there for you if you need us. I personally I am concerned for our 1st  Friday parishioners, some of them have been without the Eucharist for some  time. Should they want to receive Holy Communion we can arrange it for them;  please ask your elderly loved ones if they would like to receive Holy Communion.  For them it might be a bigger deal then you may think. Please look out for our  parishioners living alone. It is very easy to feel alone and isolated during  this lockdown. We wish all our parishioners to know they belong to the faith  community and their spiritual physical and mental welfare is very much a  priority which us. If you yourself feel isolated, feel free to contact us on  051 643112 or on 087 2408078. We are on the other end of the phone.</p>
      <p><strong>SERVICE of LIGHT     7.30pm this Wednesday Nov 11th</strong><br>
        <strong>Month of the Holy Souls. </strong> This November we are praying for and  remembering all our deceased loved ones. On Wednesday night the 11th of November  a special service of light will take place in Piltown Church. You can join us  at 7.30 p.m. on the webcam at <em>templeorumparish.com. </em>We will call out the names of all who died this year. Please contact us if  you have lost a loved one this year and we will include them in our special  service. When the lockdown is over we will organise masses for all the dead,  over a few nights. This will happen even if it's in December and so we will  have a special mass which you can attend when the opportunity arises. <br>
        <strong>Memorial Cross</strong>.  We have a special sacred space on the side  entrance to Piltown Church. It's a memorial cross for our deceased  parishioners. Why not give it a visit. Leave a stone, which will be provided, to  represent your loved one, at the foot of the cross; maybe drop into the church  and light a candle for them or visit the grave and gain an indulgence for them. <br>
        <strong>A Prayer for those who have died. </strong> God of consolation, we remember those who have died: For those who  passed away quietly, we ask for a joyful passage into your spacious heart. For  those who suffered great pain, we ask for respite and the comfort of your  compassionate embrace. For those who died too soon in sudden and unexpected  ways, we ask for peace and surrender in your loving care. Grant all those who  have died the grace of your eternal life and light. Amen. <br>
        <strong>Lockdown. </strong> <strong>I  am asking you our Parishioners to join me outside Piltown Church at 5 p.m. on  Wednesday November 18th  to  have a silent prayerful protest at the closure of our churches. Remember to  keep social distancing!  </strong>It's not just sad, it's a disgrace that our churches  here are closed. It would seem that going to church is seen as &ldquo;less important&rdquo;  by our Government. They view it as an optional recreation not as important or  as essential as going to the hairdressers or gym, which was the case in Level  3. We are still on lockdown at level 5. The majority of European countries are  still permitting public worship. Closing the churches may not mean much if one&rsquo;s  faith is weak or indifferent. But for people of faith this is a severe blow to  their spiritual and mental welfare. They are deprived of a fundamental right  and many are losing hope, feel isolated and alone. We are a community of  believers and we sustain one another by coming together, praying, socialising  and feeding on the Body of Christ. This is not an optional recreation or &ldquo;less  important&rdquo;. It is a life-giving event for people who believe. The gospel is a  road map and source of strength for getting through the Pandemic. <strong>Spiritual lives matter!</strong><br>
        <strong>Thank you</strong> to  all our volunteers who have don't Trojan work in ensuring our churches are  spotless and  dedication. We are indebted  to you. <strong></strong><br>
        Thank you for October Stations; if they&rsquo;ve been  overlooked please drop them in to Parish Office, likewise with your weekly  envelope offerings.<br>
